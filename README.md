# NLP_sentiments
Analyse sentiments and natural language processing

Twitter data was used from kaggle to see the sentiments from around 30000 tweets.
Positive sentiments were labeled 0 and negative sentiments 1.

Naive Bayes algorithm was used to the sentiment classification and it does not do a very good job
with recall around 0.47 and precision around 0.58. A lot of negative tweets are flagged as positive
and escapes further action such as human review and moderation which is not the best outcome.

Other classification models might do a better job and a more balanced data set might be useful.
